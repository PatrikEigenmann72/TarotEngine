## Author

Hello, my name is **Patrik Eigenmann**. I spent nine years as a software engineer working with Java and C# on server-side backend projects. Along the way, I picked up PHP, HTML, and CSS. Later I pivoted to audio—now I work full-time as a Sound Engineer and production manager for large-scale corporate and private live events.

Even now, I still write software in C and Java, especially GUI applications. It’s a passion I never dropped. Programming helps me reflect, learn, and structure my thoughts about how the world works. Most of my projects come from real-world needs.

If you find this project useful, consider donating a few bucks via [PayPal](mailto:p.eigenmann@gmx.net). I appreciate every small contribution—it encourages me to keep developing practical, usable tools that solve real problems.

Thanks for checking out my repo. I hope it helps you.
