     * The main method acts as the starting point of the application. When the program
     * is launched, execution begins here, ensuring that all necessary components are
     * initialized and the user interface is displayed.
     *
     * This method is responsible for setting the application in motion. It ensures
     * that the primary frame is created and rendered within the correct thread
     * context to maintain responsiveness and stability.
     *
     * In structured software design, having a clearly defined entry point allows for
     * predictable execution, making the application easy to manage and extend.
     *
     * @param args Command-line arguments passed during application startup.
     *             These can be used for configuration or debugging but are
     *             typically not required in standard executions.
